# Project 1
This folder contains benchmarks and codes from project 1 in FYS3150. 

The program (with benchmarks...not yet) can be found in the program folder.

The results of the computations can be found in the results folder. The number in the file (10, 100 or 1000) represents the mesh size used for the computations. In the text files for the tridiagonal solver and the specialized solver the first column is presenting the x values, the second column is presenting the exact values and the third column is presenting the approximate values. In the results from the LU decomposition I have only written one array to the file. This is the approximative values.
